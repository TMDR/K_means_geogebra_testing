# K_means_geogebra_testing
App.java is the file to actually calculate K_means clusters and you can use it with manual dataset
but for more simplicity and visuality and for testing my app i decided to python selenium web driver and geogebra for that. The version of the app that takes input from geogebra is in the file create_set_of_point_from_geogebra.java
# system requirements
. Java JDK11
. python (for geogebra dataset gathering)
. selenium in python (install it using pip install selenium) (for geogebra dataset gathering)
